# 🌟 Memory Lane — Static Blog Website

Memory Lane is a fully static, multi-page website built for the **1.9 Assignment: Memory Lane**. 

It demonstrates my ability to create and deploy a custom-styled blog using only **HTML** and **CSS**.

The site includes a homepage that lists all blog posts, three individual post pages, clear navigation between pages, and an About page describing the project.
